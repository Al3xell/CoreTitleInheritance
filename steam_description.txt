Summary:
This mod adds in a system to allow characters to retain more titles on succession under the partition succession laws. It achieves this goal by allowing them to designate titles as "core" which will cause them to be inherited by the character's heir. The user can optionally set a core title limit, add a cost to coring or holding core titles, or give core title counties a slight benefit.

How to use the mod:
- Owned titles of county tier or higher will have a designate core or de-designate core button on the title window.
- Core titles can be seen in the character window for any character with cores (this should be any character with a title). To see them click on where it says Core Titles in the middle of the window next to the titles, claims, and diplomacy. This will expand the core titles tab which will display the character's core titles split into the core leaves (core titles with no cores de-jure under them) and the core branches (all other core titles). The titles will have an outline according to the reason for them being core. If the reason is due to the player designating them they will not have a colored outline. The primary title will have a purple outline. The capital and titles de-jure above it (below the tier of the primary title) will have a blue outline. Special titles (currently only head of faith titles) will have an orange outline.
- The in-game encyclopedia has descriptions of the mechanics and concepts introduced.
- There is a decision to de-designate all designated cores
- There is a character interaction to recalculate core titles. It should not have to be used except in some edge cases as described in the current bugs section.

Some details of how the mod works:
- A character's core titles are the (mostly) complete set of titles which their heir is guaranteed to inherit upon their death. Some titles will be core for every character just based on the base game mechanics (with a few exceptions due to title succession laws). These titles are a character's primary title, their realm capital and the titles de-jure above it up to one tier below their highest, and head of faith titles.
- All other core titles will have been designated as core by the character. Designating a title core also designates all of the titles de-jure above it core up to an existing core title or the highest owned tier of title. This is required to guarantee inheritance based on how the game distributes titles for succession.
- The only core titles which will count to the core limit or have a cost are the core leaves (the titles with no de-jure descendant core titles) which were designated as core by the character (as opposed to being core due to mechanics in the base game).
- One cannot designate titles de-jure under at title with title succession laws as core (with limited exceptions)

The mod is *not* achievement compatible.
The mod should be safe to add to an existing game, but it might take up to a quarter for it to be fully active.

Known bugs:
- Core titles are not recalculated when the primary title is changed or the realm capital is moved.
- The first overtime core leaf cost can take a day to apply.
- There are two known cases where it is possible to lose core titles:
    1. If a character's primary title has title specific succession with an heir that is not of your dynasty and is unlanded. On inheriting the title they will take the de-jure capital of the title, possibly taking despite it being a core title of that or a different character.
    2. If a character's primary title has title specific succession with an heir that is not of your dynasty. Any core titles designated by the character will go to the heir who inherits their capital, which can be different from their player heir who will be the one to inherit the first title in the title list of the highest remaining tier after the primary title is gone. In the case of partition succession with your children inheriting, your oldest child will be the one to receive the capital, but you will not play as them after dying.

Possible future features:
- AI designation of core titles. Currently, the AI will never designate titles core.
- Changing the display of core titles in the character window to be a two wide grid like is seen when expanding titles.
- Adding a way to remove core titles from a character/from a game (unsure which or if it will be both) after single heir succession laws have been passed.

Mod compatibility guesses:
- This mod modifies the title window and character window guis. It will most likely be incompatible with other mods which also modify them, though in the case of the character window its only purpose is to present information to the player, and without it the mod should still be functional, just difficult to tell what is going on.
- This mod adds calls to additional on_actions or in one case an additional effect to on_actions from the base game. This also has the potential to have/cause conflicts.
