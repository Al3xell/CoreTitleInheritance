designate_core = {
    scope = character
    saved_scopes = {
        title
    }
    is_shown = {
        root is local player
        player owns title?
    }
    
    is_valid = {
        check eligible for title
            if county or barony root core less than limit
            if duchy check that title beneath is owned - too many duchy limit still in place
            if kingdom check that duchy title beneath is owned - too many duchy limit still in place
    }
    
    effect = {
        possible cost depending on game rule
        set title to be inherited by primary
        increase core holdings of character by 1
        #custom_tooltip = ""
    }
}

what I need:
set title as core function
    - modifier for holding if game rule needs
    - count of core holdings
    - Keep as core on inheritance? - figure out how that works
check eligible title funtion
possibly tell AI how to use this feature
kept duchies will ignore core holdings.
